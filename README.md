# Hangman
First java project recreating the classic game 'Hangman'.
The file I used for generating the words is taken from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words. It contains 466,000 English words,
which is serious overkill for a game of Hangman. Most of the words have either fallen out of use or are very esoteric, so as it stands the
game is much harder than it needs to be. Working on creating a lite version of this file. 
However, the code is fully functional.
